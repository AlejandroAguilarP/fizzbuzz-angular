# Fizz Buzz FrontEnd

## Design

I have decided to implement bootstrap for easier layout design of the project.
I consider make a simple and user friendly application. I decide to make a colorful theme with my css, with two cards, each one for one endpoint. 
I used specific colors for each answer case, such as blue for fizz numbers, red for buzz numbers and purple for fizzbuzz numbers.

I try to do somthing useful and helpful for the real people to undertand the fizzbuzz number's logic. In the first case, check what kind of number is any number that the user enters. For the sequence I try to do something more visual to watch all the list give, according to the limit number entered by the user.


## Unit test

I decide to use unit test like the most appropiate for the project.
First the components, can load all the dependencies and the mockup correctly, then the serviceÂ´s methods for request the information. I test the correct urls for each method, according to the required syntax.
